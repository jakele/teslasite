<p>Navigate on Autopilot intelligently suggests lane changes to keep you on your route, and makes adjustments so you donâ€™t get stuck behind slow cars or trucks.</p>

<p>Enable Navigate on Autopilot by going to Controls &gt; Autopilot and first enabling Autosteer. For each route where the feature is available, you have the option of enabling or disabling it by pressing the NAVIGATE ON AUTOPILOT button located in your Navigation turn list.</p>

<p>Once enabled for your route, Navigate on Autopilot can be activated on controlled-access roads by moving the gear lever fully down twice in quick succession. While activated, a single blue line will indicate the path ahead, keeping your car in the lane. Gray lines may appear to indicate upcoming lane changes based on your route or to suggest opportunities for you to move to a faster lane. When active, Navigate on Autopilot will also guide your car toward highway interchanges and exits based on your destination.</p>

<p>Adjust how aggressive Navigate on Autopilot makes lane changes to keep your car at the set speed by changing the SPEED BASED LANE CHANGES setting which can be found in Controls &gt; Autopilot &gt; CUSTOMIZE NAVIGATE ON AUTOPILOT.</p>

<p>Note: Before this feature can be enabled, camera calibration will be required, and the latest version of Navigation maps must be downloaded via WiFi.</p>
